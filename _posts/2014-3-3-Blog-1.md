Today was my first IT lesson in year 9 and also my first time having Mr Tansley as my teacher. Today’s lesson was seemingly easy however that’s probably because it was the first lesson. We used google sheets for the first time to create a spreadsheet with the prices and amounts of different items. It wasn’t as easy as it sounds as we had to research the actual price of the item and we couldn’t work it out in our head we had to times the boxes together using a simple sort of code. We also had to make it so there was a autocorrect feature when searching for an item. I look forward to next week's lesson.
